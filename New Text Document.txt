git commit -m "1. backend/src/OrderService.php (New File)
This is a new service dedicated to managing order files on the server.
Path: backend/src/OrderService.php2. backend/src/GoogleSheetsService.php (Updated)
This service is updated with the writeOrdersBatch function. The rest of the functions from the old version (getSheetData, verifyAndUpdateStock) are still required and should remain in this file.
Path: backend/src/GoogleSheetsService.php3. backend/api/index.php (Updated)
This file is now updated to use the new OrderService instead of writing directly to Google Sheets on every order.
Path: backend/api/index.php4. backend/admin/index.php (Updated)
This is the final, complete version of the admin dashboard with the new order syncing functionality.
Path: backend/admin/index.php5. backend/admin/update_cache.php (Minor Change)
We just need to add a redirect back to the admin page with a success message.
